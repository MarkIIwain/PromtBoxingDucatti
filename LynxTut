#\Let me re-introduce my vision of html meta-tags. before that there was once a
#\.html file first. no matter it belongs to what collection, or it either still
#\live on the web. the point was to interact how to consider a page and to rate
#\with certain ''votes''. it may seem familiar in some anime ideal of Iso word-
#\pro time. the main idea was ''abuse'' the strati-fication. it was going like
#\a scheme. those would get into some economic circle. but first do bookings.
#
#\the feel like it would be any thing-could-be-done just through the Synchroni
#\ze, the must have tool is such browser provided account service, like fire
#\fox bookmark. and it have to deal with editing the tag by desktop orso to ma
#\-ke it work, i mean such system was said the brain-less pulled by strings.Or
#\something only work on such terminal ''crack the mind''. it was such propaga
#\-nda system tool you may found in a chill. 
#
#\then it goes, in another shape the meta-tags. i mean not the BGA patch you m
#\-ay found on circuit board, which stand for some sorcerer-craft like manifes
#\-ting Door@! open command. I would consider if it would deal with bunch of l
#\-isted cluster hyperlinks. which was stepp behind to let the talk between if
#\people get into feel something from static todo-list whether intrude& harmed.
#\I knew it would not work. but it gave someone know it first to maintain for
#\like a better use. I'm not blame the true tech, it doing nothing with worship
#
#\It was said could be some not conspicious way to manipulate the tag was avail
#\-able, like "meme" which form tag of thorough delivered message but no fare
#\gonna be signed like early day postal. actually still brain-less. for a bette
#\-r to take, it was given people to calculate for reminder. what you need may
#\just a couple of wrap-box-work to turn over and tic-tac-toe on the back.any
#\way, that would not be humilating.
